    JMX (Java Management Extensions) is the standard management solution in the
    Java world. Since JDK 1.5 it is available in every Java Virtual Machine and
    especially JEE application servers use this technology intensively for exposing
    managable entities.

    We love JMX. It is a well crafted specification, created in times
    where other concepts like EJBs failed spectacularly. Even more
    than ten years after its incubation it is still the one-and-only
    when it comes to management in the Java world. What I like
    especially are the various levels of sophistications for
    implementing MBeans, starting with dead simple `Standard MBeans` and
    ending in universal Open MBeans (to verify).

    Some of advanced concepts didn't really hit the public and are now
    probably obsolete. Add-on standards like JSR-77 didn't received
    the adoption level they deserved. And then there is JSR-160, JMX
    remoting.
