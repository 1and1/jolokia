    <note>
      Security in JSR-160 remoting is an all-or-nothing option. Either
      all MBeans are accesible or none (except your application server
      uses a SecurityManager, but that is rarely the case). Jolokia on
      the other hand alllows for fine grained security defined in a
      security policy. It allows for access restrictions on MBean
      names (or patterns), attributes, operation, source IP address
      (or a subnet) and type of Jolokia operation. This chapter will
      talk about this.
