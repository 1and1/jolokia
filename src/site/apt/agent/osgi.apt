OSGi Agent

 For using an agent within an OSGi container, Jolokia comes with
 agents packaged OSGi bundles. It comes in two flavours:

 * The standard bundle which has an OSGi dependency on an HttpService
   as specified by the OSGi group. An good implementation of an
   HttpService can be found on. This bundle follows the OSGi
   philosophy as it contains its own functionality.

 * A all-in-one bundle with no external dependencies except the core
   OSGi bundle. It includes an embedded Jetty server and is suitable
   for situations where ease of deployment is more important than
   modularity.

  Note, that some OSGi container (like Spring dm Server) comes with a
  so called <Web extender> which allows for deployment of stanard
  Webarchives (war). For such container, there is a choice between the
  OSGi bundle and the WAR agent, where the later is probably easier to
  deploy since there is already an HTTP Service running in such
  container, which are not necessarily exports an OSGi HTTP service
  required by the standard bundle.
