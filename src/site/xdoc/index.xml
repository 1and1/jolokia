      Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160
      connectors.  It is an agent based approach with support for many
      platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX
      remoting with unique features like bulk requests or fine grained
      security policies. Have a look yourself at these <a

          Well, it's really more work than expected, but setting up a
          proper web site and making a release is really, really much
          work. I wanted to have it ready right now, but its not yet
          finished (e.g. I'm still waiting on some
          icons). Nevertheless, it's still more than a skeleton, so I
          push it out <strong>now</strong> (without big announcement
          yet). Of course, final touches will hapen until november as
          well as a <em>regular</em> (== non-snapshot) release.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Release soon, release often</em>. That's what they told
          me.

        <p>
          The current snapshot release 0.80-SNAPSHOT which you can
          find on the <a href="./download.html">Download</a> page and
          on out maven repository is identical to the agent part of <a
          href="http://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl-0.72/">jmx4perl
          0.72</a> feature- and codewise. So it 
          <strong>is</strong> quite usable ;-).

      <subsection name="Version 0.80 released">
        Jolokia 0.80 is the initial release. It is the direct the
        successor of the agent part from Jmx4Perl 0.72 with no
        additional features. Get it from the
        <a href="download.html">Download</a> page and read the
