      Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160
      connectors.  It is an agent based approach with support for many
      platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX
      remoting with unique features like bulk requests or fine grained
      security policies.

          2011 in Antwerp, Belgium. I'm really excited to have the
          chance to bring some chili pepper to this superb premium
          conference which I greatly enjoyed as visitor in the
          past. 30 minutes are surely not long enough for getting in
          every feature, so please le me know whether you have a

          The second conference where Jolokia will play its role this
          autumn is at the Open Source Monitoring Conference "<a
          href="http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/y2011/programm/v/nagios_java_monitoring_mit_jmx4perl_und_jolokia/">Nagios
          Java monitoring with Jmx4Perl and Jolokia</a>" in Nuremberg
          on November 30th 2011. It's a quite different talk with
          focus on Jmx4Perl, discovery of relevant monitoring metrics
          and it's configuration in a Nagios environment. Not much
          Java here, but tooling en masse. I'm really looking forward
          to this home play, too.

          If you intend to participate in one of these conferences and
          would like some discussion about Jolokia, Jmx4Perl, JMX,
          Chili pepper growing, the world, you can contact me on various
          channels. Jolokia can be found at twitter at <code><a
          href="http://twitter.com/jolokia_jmx">@jolokia_jmx</a></code>,
          the <a href="forum.html">forum</a> or on IRC at the Freenode
          channel <code>#jolokia</code>. For a simple chat you can use
          also the new <a href="irc.html">webchat</a> on this site. I
          would really like to hear from you !

      <subsection name="Summer break is over and 0.95 is here">
        <div class="news-date">2011-08-21</div>        
        <p>
          The summer break is over and Jolokia is one step closer to
          1.0. Germans might reasonably argue, 'ehm, what summer do
          you talk about ?' but at least 0.95 is a fact and introduces
          two new features. Very cool features, IMO.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jolokia <a href="agent/jvm.html">JDK6 JVM Agent</a> is
          now able to use the <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/attach/spec/com/sun/tools/attach/VirtualMachine.html">Java
          Attach API</a> so that it is possible to dynamically attach
          and detach a Jolokia agent to a running Java process, much
          like <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html">jconsole</a>. It
          is a really exciting and powerful feature, because it allows
          for HTTP/JSON access without (permanently) instrumenting a
          Java process by deploying an agent or modifying startup
          options, which is a major obstacle for quite some users. The
          nice advantage over <code>jconsole</code> is that it
          attaches <em>locally</em> but export the data
          <em>remotely</em>. Perfect for headless server
          installations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second addition is the support for upstream
          serialization of all <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/openmbean/OpenType.html">OpenType</a>
          types so that JMX operations and write requests can be used
          with <code>OpenTypes</code>, too. For <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/MXBean.html">MXBeans</a>
          special support has been added, so that e.g. a JSON map gets
          properly translated to an MXBean's Map attribute (which in
          between gets translated to a <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/openmbean/TabularData.html">TabularData</a>
          with a fixed format). Since MXBeans are so easy to declare,
          implement and register, this missing piece really adds to
          our <em>JMX on Capsaicin</em> mantra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both features arrived via GitHub <a
          href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/pulls">pull
          requests</a> and are proofs for the relevance of the social
          coding model introduced by GitHub. Big acknowlegdments go
          out to <a href="https://github.com/asssaf">Assaf Berg</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/GregBowyer">Greg Bowyer</a>
          for providing pull requests which lead to these features.
