        <p>
          We occassionally blog on
          <a href="http://labs.consol.de">http://labs.consol.de</a> about various
          topics (1-2 posts per month). There are interesting use cases how to
          setup JSR-160 connectors for <a
          href="http://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/jboss-remote-jmx/">JBoss</a> 
          and <a
          href="http://labs.consol.de/blog/jmx4perl/configuring-remote-jmx-access-for-weblogic/">Weblogic</a>,
          what is the best way 
          for configuring <a

          do (and already have done for jmx4perl with quite some success):
        </p>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            Workshops for evaluating how to best integrate Jolokia (and 
            <a href="http://www.jmx4perl.org">jmx4perl</a>) in you server

            large Nagios and OP5 setups, not only for monitoring JMX MBeans
            but for Nagios in general (see here and here for some work my

        So, that was it for the plug ;-)

          Jolokia uses <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> as source
          repository. Send me pull requests for enhancing Jolokia featurewise
          or fixing some bugs. They will be considered all and potentially
          integrated after reviewinv. Please note, that all the contributed

        <p>
          Jolokia is free software, released under the business friendly
          Apache License. That's mostly because I believe that open
          source software is the real driving force behind software
          innovation and I highly appreciate the fine pieces of open
          source software engineering I had the luck to use in our daily
          work. I love this.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should probably stop reading here at this
          point ;-)
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there's a way for financially supporting this
          project. I have been asked for this possibility. Donations
          will help keeping up the movivation for further enhancements
          of Jolokia (and to honor the past development which took some
          efforts). The motivation is high anyway, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two way: Either via a direct donation with <a href="http://pledgie.com/">Pledgie</a>
          or via <a href="http://www.flattr.com">Flattr</a>, which is
          a real new revolutionary way of
          give-and-take and much fun, too. Enough said, here are the buttons:

        <div align="center">
          <div style="float:right; margin: 30px 150px 50px 100px;">
